# Crypto-App
Made a Crypto App using ReactJS.

Description :- Used an API to get the information about the coins. Presented the coins in the form of a table sorted according to their market cap. The table also showed their current price and 24 hour percentage change. Also made a seperate page to show the information about a single coin when clicked on it. Used Chart js to show price history of a particular coin in a graphical manner. Allows us to see the data in both INR and USD
